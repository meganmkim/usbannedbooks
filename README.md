# Record High Book Ban in 2021-2022 Driven by Four States
*Lede Program: Project 1*

## Overview ##
The goal of this project was to learn how to slice up the data in various ways using pandas on Jupyter Notebook, and then to translate the simplified data into graphs using DataWrapper. Lastly, this project was used to familiarize myself with GitHub and CSS/HTML (using Bulba.io). 

***

## Findings ##
* A significant portion of the book bans in 2021-2022 were driven by 4 States (over 85% of the challenges): Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee, respectively 
* Within these states, there were specific districts that filed the challenges

## Database ##
**Main Data Source:** [America's Index of School Bans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=1171606318)

*Additional Attempts/Goals*
*I was not able to incorporate the following ideas, due to lack of skills and time limitation:*
* *Layer legislation dates passed in these four states (information was collected for some of the states through research) and the subsequent banning of books (the date is listed in the data source). Ideally, I would have wanted to create a graph that shows the timeline of how passed legislation was tied to the banning of books.*
* *Additionally, I was interested in pinpointing the Moms for Liberty chapters and showing the correlation between the chapters and the districts with bans. For example, one of the districts that banned a bunch of books, was also where one of the founders for Moms for Liberty was residing.*
