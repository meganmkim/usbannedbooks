                <h1 class="headline super-font">Record High Book Ban in 2021-2022 Driven by Four States</h1>
                <p class="credit super-font">By Megan Kim</p>
                <p class="intro"> In the 2021-2022 school year, PEN America has indexed 2,531 instances in which books
                    were banned, either removed or prohibited. The breadth of these bans spanned cross 86
                    school districts in 26 states, affecting over 2 million students. These numbers feel overwhelmingly
                    large, particularly when one banned book feels significantly impactful on its own. The rising number
                    of banned books continues to increase over the years, but to effectively understand its roots we
                    need to understand who, where, and what is driving this malignant movement.</p>


                <div class="body-text sub-font">

                    <div style="min-height:613px">
                        <script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OkFZ8/embed.js?v=2"
                            charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OkFZ8/full.png"
                                alt="" /></noscript>
                    </div>

                    <p>When the numbers are broken down by State, it becomes clear that there are four States that
                        account for over 85% of the banned books in 2021-2022: Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and
                        Tennessee. In total, these four States have filed 2,174 bans. These removals include overlapping
                        titles and authors that are banned across various school districts. Unsurprisingly, most of the
                        books targeted two main topics: LGBTQ+ identities and racial inequality (<a
                            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/books/book-bans-united-states-free-speech.html">
                            NYT</a>). What’s surprising is that in Texas and Pennsylvania, a significant amount of
                        the bans are being driven by a select few school districts. In Texas, the North East Independent
                        School District accounts for over 50% of the bans within the State and over 17% of the overall
                        bans in the U.S. Similarly, the Central York School District in Pennsylvania is responsible for
                        96.3% of the State’s bans and over 17% of the overall bans. Millions of students are still
                        impacted
                        by banning of books, but the growing list is highly concentrated in specific districts.</p>

                    <p>There are a handful of school districts within four States that are escalating their endeavor to
                        ban more books from both classrooms and libraries. Why is this the case? At the state-level,
                        legislation is being passed to make it easier to ban books, ranging from Florida’s ‘Don’t Say
                        Gay’ law to Texas state representative Matt Krause’s compiled list of 850 books that he believes
                        should be
                        banned (<a
                            href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">PEN
                            America</a>). In other cases, like in Tennessee’s Collierville school district, 327 books
                        were removed in anticipation of a state law that was never passed (<a
                            href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">PEN
                            America</a>). The legislation opens the doors for various grassroots organizations, like
                        Moms for Liberty, to ban more books at the district level.

                        Is it possible that by specifically targeting and educating a handful of these groups in these
                        districts on the benefits of critical thinking and reading materials that address
                        real issues of race, gender, and sexuality may reduce or even halt the momentum of the book ban
                        movement?</p>
