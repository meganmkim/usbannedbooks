                <p class="credit super-font">By Megan Kim</p>
                <p class="intro">	In the 2021-2022 school year, PEN America has indexed in 2,531 instances in which books were banned, in which books were removed or prohibited. The breadth of these bans spanned cross 86 school districts in 26 states, affecting over 2 million students. These numbers feel overwhelmingly large, particularly when one banned book feels significantly impactful on its own. The rising number of banned books continues to increase over the years, but to effectively understand its roots we need to understand who, where, and what is driving this malignant movement.</p>

    
                <div class="body-text sub-font">

                    <div style="min-height:613px"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OkFZ8/embed.js?v=2" charset="utf-8"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OkFZ8/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>
                    
                    <p>When the numbers are broken down by State, it becomes clear that there are four States that account for over 85% of the banned books in 2021-2022: Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. In total, these four States have filed 2,174 bans. These removals include overlapping titles and authors that are banned across various school districts. Unsurprisingly, most of the books targeted either discuss LGBTQ+ identities and racial inequality, according to <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/books/book-bans-united-states-free-speech.html"> the NYT</a>. What’s surprising is that in Texas and Pennsylvania, a significant amount of the bans are being driven by a select few school districts. In Texas, the North East Independent School District accounts for over 50% of the bans within the State and over 17% of the overall bans in the U.S.  Similarly, the Central York School District in Pennsylvania is responsible for 96.3% of the State’s bans and over 17% of the overall bans. The news circulating around the book bans isn’t novel, but it’s not as widespread as one might initially think.</p>

                    <p>There are a handful of school districts within four States that are escalating their endeavor to ban more books from both classrooms and libraries. Why is this the case?

                     <p>There are a handful of school districts within four States that are escalating their endeavor to ban more books from both classrooms and libraries. Why is this the case? At state-level, legislation is being passed to make it easier to ban books, ranging from Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law to Texas state representative Matt Krause’ compiled list of 850-books that should be banned (<a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">Pen America</a>). In other cases, like in Tennessee’s Collierville school district, 327 books were removed in anticipation of state law that never passed (<a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">Pen America</a>). The legislation opens the doors for various grassroots organizations, like Moms for Liberty, to ban more books at the district level. Is it possible that by educating a handful of individuals of the benefits of critical thinking and reading materials that  address real issues of race, gender, and sexuality may reduce or even halt the book ban movement?</p>
